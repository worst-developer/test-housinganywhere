To run back-end server u need go to api folder and using command - ```yarn dev-server``` you can start the server, before you need to install dependencies. </br>
To run fron-end you need to use command - ```yarn start``` from root folder. </br>

to finish it I just need to write sagas file to run api call and process response, add 3,4,5 steps and add some css it is not a lot of work.
